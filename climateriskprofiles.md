# Climate Risk Profiles

Climate Risk Profiles provide a snapshot of climate hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities for specific cities or regions. This section summarizes key hazards such as floods, droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves, and shows how to integrate local data into risk assessments.



Effective adaptation starts with understanding the **climate risks** a region faces. This section provides an overview of the most pertinent hazards – **fluvial and flash floods, prolonged droughts, forest wildfires, and heatwaves** – with emphasis on how climate change is altering their frequency and intensity. For a given region, this can be tailored to include relevant historical data and projections (accessible via CKAN datasets or climate portals). Key points to cover for each hazard:

*   **Floods:** Describe flood types (riverine, coastal, pluvial) and their drivers (e.g. extreme rainfall or sea-level rise). Note recent trends or events – for instance, _“in May 2023, Emilia-Romagna received six months’ worth of rain in one week, causing floods across 32 municipalities”_&#x200B;

    [ib-green.nweurope.eu](https://ib-green.nweurope.eu/blog/ib-green-news-26/focus-on-adaptation-70). Discuss how climate change increases heavy precipitation events, leading to greater flood risk.
*   **Droughts:** Explain characteristics of meteorological and agricultural droughts. Include data on precipitation deficits and rising temperatures. Highlight that severe droughts in Europe have already reduced vegetation productivity by a few percent annually in affected areas​

    [eea.europa.eu](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-impacts-risks-and-adaptation), and climate change is expected to exacerbate water scarcity.
*   **Wildfires:** Outline wildfire risk factors such as heat, drought, and land management. Note that even regions not traditionally prone to fires are experiencing more frequent wildfires when heatwaves and droughts coincide​

    [eea.europa.eu](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-impacts-risks-and-adaptation). Describe the implications for ecosystems and settlements (e.g. interface fires threatening homes).
*   **Heatwaves:** Define heatwaves and their health impacts. Provide statistics on increasing frequency of extreme heat – for example, mention how the summer of 2023 saw record-breaking temperatures in Italian cities (≥39 °C in Bologna)​

    [ib-green.nweurope.eu](https://ib-green.nweurope.eu/blog/ib-green-news-26/focus-on-adaptation-70). Emphasize urban heat island effects and the particular vulnerability of cities to sustained high temperatures​[eea.europa.eu](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-impacts-risks-and-adaptation).

For each hazard, include a short **“Risk Profile”** subsection that identifies: the exposed people and assets (e.g. population in floodplains, agricultural land prone to drought, forest areas at fire risk, urban neighborhoods vulnerable to heat) and the expected impacts (economic damages, health outcomes, ecological consequences). Wherever possible, link to **interactive maps or data** – for instance, a flood hazard map or climate projection graph stored in the CKAN data repository – so users can visualize risk in their region. This section sets the stage for why Nature-Based Solutions are needed as part of the adaptation strategy.
