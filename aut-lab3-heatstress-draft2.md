## Introduction and Objectives of the Climate Risk Assessment

### Regional context.

The Innovation Lab 3 is located in [Lower
Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Austria), with a focus on
the urban area of
[**Amstetten**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstetten,_Lower_Austria).
The region combines medium-sized urban centres, densely built
residential zones, and surrounding rural areas. Rising temperatures,
limited vegetation in central districts, and a high proportion of sealed
surfaces contribute to an intensification of **urban heat stress**.

This hazard is further amplified by the **urban heat island effect**,
where built-up zones record significantly higher air and surface
temperatures compared to adjacent rural surroundings. Vulnerable
groups—such as the elderly, children, and people with pre-existing
health conditions—are particularly at risk.

Urban heat stress represents a **priority climate risk** for Amstetten
and similar Austrian towns, with direct impacts on **public health,
liveability, and energy demand for cooling**.

**Climate Projections** from public datasets indicate that the
**frequency, duration, and intensity of heatwaves** will increase under
future climate scenarios, posing long-term adaptation challenges.

Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) such as **expansion of tree canopy,
creation of public green spaces, and installation of green roofs**
(Figure 2) are identified as the most relevant adaptation strategies to
mitigate urban heat in this regional context.

The Climate Risk Assessment in this therefore focuses on testing the
effectiveness of these NbS to reduce thermal stress and to provide
evidence for integration into **urban planning and adaptation
strategies**.

### Scope of the tutorial.

This tutorial outlines a **replicable Climate Risk Assessment (CRA)
workflow** for urban heat stress in Amstetten.

The methodology combines **climate datasets, socio-economic data, and
high-resolution geospatial information** with the **PALM-4U urban
climate model** to identify hotspots of heat exposure and test the
cooling potential of NbS interventions.

The workflow is designed to be **transferable to other regions**, even
outside Austria, by suggesting **open and European-wide datasets** (e.g.
Copernicus, EURO-CORDEX) when national or local data are unavailable. It
does not require advanced programming and, at the current stage, the CRA
relies on existing datasets and modelling tools.

The aim is to support **urban planning, public health strategies, and
climate adaptation policies**, providing evidence-based insights for
municipalities and regional authorities. The outputs allow for
**prioritisation of greening measures**, **evaluation of vulnerable
districts**, and **long-term integration of NbS** into adaptation
strategies.

### CRA objectives.

The Climate Risk Assessment (CRA) in Amstetten aims to:

  - **Identify and quantify high-risk heat exposure zones**, especially
    in urban areas with limited vegetation and high sealing.

  - **Evaluate the effectiveness of NbS interventions** (tree canopy
    management, public green spaces, green roofs) in reducing thermal
    stress.

  - **Provide technical evidence (spatial risk assessment) to be
    integrated into urban planning processes**, enabling proactive and
    spatially differentiated decision-making.

  - **Provide evidence base for investment in green infrastructure**,
    public awareness, and long-term climate resilience.

  - **Acknowledge limitations** related to microclimatic variability,
    climate projection uncertainties, and NbS performance under extreme
    heat scenarios.

### Intended users.

The CRA in Lab 3 is designed for stakeholders involved in **urban
planning, environmental health, and climate adaptation policy**.

The intended users include:

  - **City administrations and municipal planning departments** – to
    integrate heat risk maps and NbS scenarios into local development
    frameworks.

  - **Public health authorities** – to identify vulnerable groups and
    prepare targeted protection measures during heatwaves.

  - **Municipal environmental departments and regional authorities** –
    to prioritise NbS interventions and guide climate adaptation
    strategies.

By providing spatially explicit evidence, the CRA enables these actors
to **prioritize interventions, develop adaptation strategies, and embed
NbS** into decision-making processes for stronger long-term urban
resilience.

## Hazard – Urban heat stress.

### Description and context

The city of **Amstetten** faces a growing risk of **urban heat stress**,
intensified by the **urban heat island (UHI) effect**. Dense built-up
areas with sealed surfaces and limited vegetation retain heat, resulting
in significantly higher air and surface temperatures compared to
surrounding rural zones.

This condition threatens **public health, comfort, and liveability**,
especially for vulnerable groups such as elderly citizens, children, and
people with pre-existing medical conditions. Climate projections from
**EURO-CORDEX** and **ÖKS15** datasets indicate a steady rise in the
**frequency, duration, and intensity of heatwaves** in the coming
decades.

To address these challenges, the CRA supports both the identification
and quantification of high-risk heat exposure zones and provides an
evidence base for evaluating the effectiveness of **Nature-Based
Solutions (NbS)**, including:

  - management and expansion of urban **tree canopy**,

  - creation of **public green spaces**,

  - deployment of **green roofs**.

The assessment, thus, focuses on quantifying the **cooling potential**
of these NbS interventions and on identifying areas of **highest
vulnerability** within Amstetten.

### Data sources and tools

The Climate Risk Assessment (CRA) in Lab 3 combines datasets on
**climate hazards, exposure, and vulnerability** under both current and
future conditions. Required inputs include **climate projections,
high-resolution geospatial data, building geometries, land cover, urban
tree inventories, and socio-economic indicators**. These datasets
provide the basis for heat stress simulations and for the derivation of
spatially explicit risk indicators.

In relation to **topography**, urban climate models benefit from
**high-resolution terrain and surface data** to represent accurately
both ground morphology and above-ground structures such as buildings and
vegetation. While **LiDAR-based products** are preferable, at present a
**national DTM at 10 × 10 m resolution** has been identified (Figure 4)
as the available baseline source for Amstetten, to be complemented where
possible by higher-resolution datasets.

when regional data are unavailable.

  - ##### meteorological inputs  
    *Meteorological input requirements, and formatting, vary depending on the modelling code used. the required additional variables usually include air temperature, dew point or relative humidity, surface pressure, wind speed and direction, shortwave radiation (global, diffuse and direct), depending on your Modeling suite , please see* *Step 1 - Data acquisition and preparation for further advice* 

The Lab uses the **PALM-4U urban climate model** to simulate
microclimatic conditions (air temperature, surface temperature, wind,
radiation) at building level. It is applied to Amstetten for baseline
and NbS scenarios (tree canopy, green spaces, green roofs).

**GIS platforms** (QGIS, ArcGIS) are used for data preparation, spatial
integration, and visualization.

Another open alternative has been provided to foster replicability.

  - ##### Note on replicability of the CRA and tools.

> *PALM-4U is the core model for high-resolution urban climate
> simulations, but it runs only on Linux/Unix systems and typically
> requires HPC environments. To improve replicability on Windows
> systems, the open-source UMEP plugin for QGIS has been included as an
> alternative tool for UHI mapping and NbS scenario analysis.*

### Methodology

  - ##### Note temporary workflow.

> *The urban climate simulations in Lab 3 are intended to be run with
> the PALM-4U model. Due to the high computational cost and complexity,
> simulations are executed on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.
> Each run—whether baseline or NbS scenario—is resource-intensive, and
> results are treated as static datasets for downstream risk analysis.*
> 
> *At the current stage, the detailed execution workflow for PALM-4U in
> Amstetten is still under development, and comprehensive documentation
> on data preparation, model setup, and post-processing will be released
> in the course of Lab 3.*
> 
> *For tutorial purposes, an alternative workflow based on UMEP (QGIS
> plugin) is presented. This workflow uses the same data types required
> by PALM-4U, ensuring consistency in data acquisition and preparation
> while enabling replicability on standard desktop environments
> (Windows/Linux).*

#### Step 1 - Data acquisition and preparation

The first stage of the workflow consists of collecting and preparing the
spatial and environmental datasets required as inputs to the modelling
tool (UMEP, which operates within QGIS). All layers must be harmonised
in terms of coordinate system, resolution and coverage, and then
pre-processed through the plugin’s dedicated utilities.

The climate component is provided by temperature and precipitation
series from regional projections such as **ÖKS15** and **EURO-CORDEX**.
These must be converted into formats compatible with the modelling
suite, typically **EPW weather files**, which are the standard required
by UMEP for urban climate simulations. This file tells the model how to
reproduce present and future conditions consistently with other CRA
activities in Lab 3.

  - ##### meteorological inputs  
    *Meteorological input requirements and formatting vary depending on the modelling code used. For UHI simulations with UMEP (Table 2), the required variables include air temperature, dew point or relative humidity, surface pressure, wind speed and direction, shortwave radiation (global, diffuse and direct), longwave radiation, precipitation, and cloud cover. UMEP relies on the **EPW format (EnergyPlus Weather)**.* *EPW files are “typical meteorological dataset with a typical year” and can be downloaded from several sources (e.g. EnergyPlus, EPWmap ) or generated from reanalysis datasets such as **ERA5(-Land)**. Users are encouraged to download the file closest to their location and **adapt it with local meteorological data**, so that the weather inputs reflect the actual conditions of the study area.*

> *Free tools are available to inspect and modify EPW files, such as
> [Elements](https://bigladdersoftware.com/projects/elements/). We
> recommend changing the epw file after reading the official **UMEP
> documentation and tutorial examples** (Table 2) to adjust the
> variables, ensuring that the file accurately represents both the local
> climate data and the modelling requirements (*Figure 5

Figure 5 – example of EPW files as “typical meteorological dataset with
a typical year” download nearby Amstetten and open for modification.

The **topographic base** is currently represented by the national DTM at
10 × 10 m, which provides continuous coverage for Amstetten. For local
climate modelling, higher-resolution **LiDAR-derived DSMs and DTMs** are
preferable, as they capture the detailed morphology of the city and
allow the derivation of building heights. (Figure 4).

For microclimate modelling in UMEP, the main spatial datasets – building
geometries, land cover and surface sealing, and the urban tree inventory
– must be reformatted into the input structure expected by the plugin.
Building footprints are attributed with height information and aligned
with the terrain model. Land cover layers are reclassified to
distinguish impervious and vegetated surfaces, while tree datasets,
whether from local inventories or proxies such as Copernicus HRL Tree
Cover, are prepared as grids describing canopy cover and crown size. All
layers are projected into a common coordinate system, clipped to the
Amstetten study area, and harmonized in resolution.

An example of this data preparation, with building polygons on the left
and the reclassified land cover raster on the right, is shown in Figure
X based on the UMEP tutorial dataset.

Figure 6 - On the left, the vector file with building footprint polygons
classified by building type. On the right, the raster land cover layer
reclassified into impervious and vegetated surfaces according to the
UMEP tutorial. The example is derived from a sample city dataset
provided in the official UMEP documentation.

Finally, **socio-economic data** such as population density, age
distribution or income levels are included as spatial layers to be
combined later with hazard indicators. These datasets are not directly
ingested by climate modelling but are prepared in parallel to support
subsequent risk analysis.

At the end of this step, all datasets are harmonized, clipped to the
study area, and converted into the formats required by the climate
modelling suite. This ensures that the following analysis steps can be
performed consistently, with reliable representation of urban form,
surface properties, vegetation, and local climate conditions.

#### 

#### Step 2 – Analysis and mapping

With the prepared datasets, the modelling environment in UMEP is
configured to simulate **near-surface air temperature and related
thermal indicators** over the study area of Amstetten.

For example, “Urban Heat Island - Urban Weather Generator” analysis in
the UMEP plugin within QGIS, the input grids representing buildings,
land cover, and vegetation are combined with the EPW weather file to
produce a **spatially explicit simulation of urban heat conditions**.

The model calculates temperature fields and heat stress indices across
the city, allowing the identification of thermal anomalies between dense
urban cores and surrounding areas.

The outputs of this stage typically consist of **thematic layers that
visualize the spatial distribution of heat exposure** and its
relationship with key drivers such as vegetation cover, building
density, surface sealing, and population distribution.

These maps provide the evidence base for identifying priority zones
**where Nature-based Solutions, such as increased tree canopy or green
roofs, can** deliver the greatest cooling benefits.

#### Step 3 – Baseline Urban Climate Modelling

Using the datasets prepared in Step 1 and the analytical overlays from
Step 2, develop a baseline urban climate model to represent current
conditions during extreme heat events. The objective is to simulate
microclimatic patterns—such as air temperature distribution, surface
temperature, and thermal comfort indices—across the study area without
any mitigation interventions applied.

This process typically involves:

  - Importing pre-processed land cover, vegetation, and morphology grids
    into the selected modelling framework.

  - Integrating meteorological time series representative of identified
    heatwave periods.

  - Parameterizing urban form (building heights, materials, vegetation
    characteristics) to reflect present-day conditions.

Where available, satellite-derived LST maps and temperature anomaly
layers from Step 2 can be used to cross-check the model outputs,
ensuring that simulated baseline conditions (e.g. Figure 8) are
consistent with observed spatial patterns of heat stress.

These validated baseline results then serve as a quantitative reference
for evaluating the potential effects of Nature-Based Solutions in the
following step.

The baseline **represents the current urban climate conditions** in
Amstetten during extreme heat events, before the introduction of any
Nature-Based Solutions. Using the prepared datasets, the climate
modelling suite can be applied to simulate **near-surface air
temperature fields**, surface temperature distribution, and thermal
comfort indices that describe the extent and intensity of urban heat
stress across the city (e.g. Figure 8).

This initial model run provides a reference picture of the prevailing
situation, highlighting the areas most exposed to high thermal loads due
to building density, land cover composition, or lack of vegetation. The
outputs take the form of spatial maps and time series of temperature and
radiation, which can be analysed to identify hotspots and areas of
relative resilience.

Figure 8 – example of Above: Wind speed and global radiation from
epw-file. Below: Air temperature from ground station data compared with
those simulated in the grid of the model including the station (source
\[1\])

The baseline maps can also be combined w**ith socio-economic datasets,
such as population density or income levels,** to identify vulnerable
groups and evaluate the potential social and economic impacts of heat
stress. This integrated view allows the baseline to serve not only as a
technical benchmark for subsequent scenario analysis, but also as a
decision-support layer for urban planners and public authorities.

Figure 9 – example of temperature difference in mean ground temperature
\[°C\] for an urban area simulated with UMEP.

#### Step 4 – NbS scenario testing

Building on the baseline established in Step 3, alternative simulations
are carried out to test the effectiveness of selected **Nature-Based
Solutions (NbS)** in reducing urban heat stress in Amstetten. The
scenarios reflect measures highlighted in regional adaptation
strategies, in particular the **increase of urban tree canopy**, the
creation of new **public green spaces**, and the implementation of
**green roofs**.

Each scenario is configured in UMEP by modifying the spatial input
layers to represent the planned interventions, while maintaining the
same meteorological forcing used for the baseline. Doing so the
resulting maps of air temperature, surface temperature, and thermal
comfort indices shall be directly compared with the reference case.

The outputs allow quantification of the cooling effect of each NbS
option, highlighting changes in the intensity and extent of heat
hotspots and improvements in thermal comfort across different parts of
the city.

These results can be again overlaid with socio-economic and demographic
layers to identify where the benefits of adaptation measures coincide
with concentrations of vulnerable groups.

By comparing NbS scenarios against the baseline, the analysis provides a
robust basis for evaluating the potential of green interventions to
reduce heat stress and to inform local adaptation planning.
