# Decision Support Tools

This section links to external tools and platforms that assist in decision-making. Examples include:

* **Early Warning Systems:** Real-time alerts and hazard mapping.
* **Scenario Analysis Tools:** Interactive modeling for climate impacts.
* **Cost-Benefit Calculators:** Assessing the financial viability of adaptation measures.

Selecting and prioritizing adaptation measures – especially a broad set of Nature-Based Solutions – can be complex. This section introduces **decision-support tools and methodologies** that help officials and stakeholders make informed choices. Emphasis is on tools that accommodate the unique aspects of NbS (like valuing co-benefits and long-term ecosystem services, which traditional cost-benefit analysis might overlook).

Key tools and approaches include:

*   **Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA):** A robust method to compare options against a set of criteria (e.g. cost, risk reduction effectiveness, co-benefits, feasibility, maintenance requirements). NbS options often provide multiple co-benefits (for example, a park that reduces heat risk also provides recreation and habitat), so MCA allows incorporating those intangible benefits alongside quantitative metrics​

    [icarus.project.cedr.eu](https://icarus.project.cedr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/D4.2_NbS_report_v2.pdf). The toolbox could provide an MCA template or spreadsheet where users list adaptation options (both green and grey) and score them on criteria. The ICARUS project on road resilience, for example, recommends a four-step MCA to evaluate NbS options, explicitly linking criteria to key performance indicators (KPIs)​[icarus.project.cedr.eu](https://icarus.project.cedr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/D4.2_NbS_report_v2.pdf). This ensures that decisions consider not just immediate risk reduction but also sustainability and social benefits.
* **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) with Ecosystem Valuation:** Guidance on performing economic appraisal of NbS. Traditional CBA can be adapted by assigning monetary values to ecosystem services (e.g. value of flood water storage by wetlands, health cost savings from cooler urban temperatures). The toolbox can point to tools like the Natural Capital Protocol or specific calculators that estimate benefits like carbon sequestration or avoided damages. It can also mention the limitations – some benefits are hard to monetize, which is why combining CBA with MCA or cost-effectiveness analysis might be necessary.
*   **Scenario Planning and Climate Modeling Tools:** For regions facing deep uncertainty in future climate, scenario analysis tools can be useful. This might include simple techniques like stress-testing options under a dry vs wet future scenario, or using more complex tools. For example, mention open-source tools or data platforms: _“Users can leverage climate scenario data (e.g. from Euro-CORDEX or national projections available via CKAN) to see how a 2°C vs 4°C warming scenario changes flood or drought risk. Decision tools like Deltares’ hydrological models allow simulation of how NbS (like re-greening a basin) alter outcomes under these scenarios​_

    [_deltares.nl_](https://www.deltares.nl/en/news/rapid-design-of-nature-based-solutions-with-new-tool)_​_[_deltares.nl_](https://www.deltares.nl/en/news/rapid-design-of-nature-based-solutions-with-new-tool)_.”_ While not every city will run such models, the toolbox can list accessible options (perhaps a simplified “what-if” analysis template).
*   **Geospatial Tools and Risk Mapping:** Encourage use of GIS-based tools to visualize and analyze spatial data for decision making. The toolbox can integrate with QGIS (open source GIS) – for example, by providing sample QGIS projects or notebooks that show how to map risk or simulate the impact of an NbS. (The mention of CKAN datasets means the data can be pulled into GIS easily.) Some advanced users might use scripts or toolkits (like the CLIMAAX “risk workflows” or the CLIMADA model) – the guide can reference these for those interested​

    [climaax.eu](https://www.climaax.eu/handbook/toolbox/)​[climaax.eu](https://www.climaax.eu/handbook/toolbox/), but also ensure that non-experts have a user-friendly path (such as pre-made maps or an online dashboard for exploration).
*   **Policy and Planning Integration Tools:** This could include checklists or alignment matrices to ensure the chosen measures fit into existing planning frameworks. For example, a tool might be a **Policy Gap Analysis** (similar to the “policy keyword mapping” tool suggested by UNDRR/UNU) to see where NbS can be inserted into local plans​

    [unu.edu](https://unu.edu/ehs/series/5-tools-nature-based-solutions-disaster-and-climate-risk-management). Another could be a **Stakeholder Mapping tool** to identify who needs to be involved for each solution (linking to the next section on implementation).

Each tool/method subsection in this part of the guide should describe _why_ it’s useful, _when_ to use it in the planning process, and _provide an example_. For instance: _“Using Multi-Criteria Analysis: After identifying a long list of adaptation options, City X convened a workshop with officials and community representatives to score options on criteria like cost, effectiveness, maintenance, and co-benefits. Green infrastructure options scored high on co-benefits, tipping the decision in favor of including them. An MCA template is provided in the toolbox for replication.”_ Wherever possible, include links to open-source software or templates (e.g. a link to an Excel MCA tool, or instructions to use an open-source climate risk model).

Importantly, this section underscores **inclusive and transparent decision-making**. Engaging stakeholders via participatory tools (like a structured decision-making exercise or visioning scenario) can build support. The UNU toolkit highlights the value of _stakeholder engagement to build inclusive governance_, ensuring all voices are heard in the planning process​

[unu.edu](https://unu.edu/ehs/series/5-tools-nature-based-solutions-disaster-and-climate-risk-management). The guide can recommend techniques like community mapping of hazard areas or co-design sessions for NbS (with references to resources on facilitation). By using these decision-support approaches, regions can prioritize the most effective and acceptable solutions and justify their choices with evidence.
