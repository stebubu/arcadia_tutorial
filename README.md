# ARCADIA

The ARCADIA Project is a pioneering initiative aimed at enhancing climate resilience in urban areas across Europe. By integrating advanced climate adaptation strategies, the project seeks to tackle urban challenges posed by climate change. ARCADIA focuses on developing innovative tools and methodologies to support city planners and policymakers in designing sustainable, climate-resilient urban environments. The project promotes interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together experts from various fields to drive actionable solutions that enhance the adaptability of European cities against climate threats.

ARCADIA brings together 8 European regions and communities — 5 model regions (Italy, Croatia, Austria, Denmark, Sweden); 3 fellow regions (Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovenia) — to accelerate the adoption

### Context

The _EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change_ seeks to help regions and communities across Europe become resilient to climate hazards. An important pillar of this mission is **CLIMAAX**, a Horizon‐Europe project coordinated by Deltares.&#x20;

CLIMAAX is described as the flagship project of the EU mission that provides **financial, analytical and practical support** to regional authorities and communities in order to improve regional climate and emergency risk management plans[climaax.eu](https://www.climaax.eu). The project addresses the fact that reliable climate risk assessments require the combination of local information with pan‑European reference data and scenarios[cordis.europa.eu](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101093864). Many regions lack the capacity to integrate such data, so CLIMAAX will deliver a **standardised climate risk assessment (CRA) framework** and a toolbox of data, models and utilities, and will provide financial support and a help desk to at least 50 regions to carry out context‑specific assessments[cordis.europa.eu](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101093864).

Nature‑based solutions (NbS) and blue‑green infrastructure (BGI) play a central role in this context. The European Commission defines NbS as _“solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost‑effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience”_[climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/eu-adaptation-policy/key-eu-actions/NbS). Such interventions bring more diverse natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes and should benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of multiple ecosystem services[climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/eu-adaptation-policy/key-eu-actions/NbS). Because of their multi‑purpose character, NbS often deliver larger co‑benefits than conventional engineering measures[climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/eu-adaptation-policy/key-eu-actions/NbS). However, the literature notes that increased urban biodiversity and green spaces can also generate **ecosystem disservices**, such as higher risks of zoonotic diseases, intensified urban heat islands or human disconnection from nature[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.791070/full). These disservices may be amplified by climate change and therefore need to be recognised and managed alongside the desired benefits[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.791070/full).

### Purpose of the task

The task described in the _Assessment Toolkit_ aims to enable **model regions** to assess the **risk‑reduction performance** of NbS and blue‑green infrastructure projects, as well as their co‑benefits and potential unintended consequences (ecosystem disservices and response risks). Building on the CLIMAAX framework and other related projects and data hubs (see Section 1.2.5 of the report), the task will develop a **regional risk assessment toolkit** that integrates evolving climate hazard data with projections of exposure and social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities. Each model region will co‑design and apply locally adapted assessment models and methods through **innovation labs**, ensuring that the tools are tailored to local conditions and stakeholder needs. The first round of these labs will provide a testbed to evaluate and improve the toolkit, facilitating iterative learning and the refinement of metrics, datasets and analytical workflows.

By combining the CLIMAAX CRA framework with NbS assessment methods, the task will help regions quantify how interventions such as wetlands, urban forests or agroforestry reduce flood and heat risks, store carbon, enhance biodiversity and deliver social benefits. At the same time, the toolkit will encourage practitioners to identify and mitigate any unintended impacts, promoting adaptive and resilient regional strategies.
