# Indicators and Data

This section provides key indicators and datasets to support the risk assessment, including:

* **Hazard Indicators:** Historical frequency of extreme events, flood maps, drought indices.
* **Exposure Indicators:** Population density, infrastructure, land use data.
* **Vulnerability Indicators:** Social vulnerability metrics, quality of buildings, ecosystem health.

Data-driven indicators are essential for both assessing risks and monitoring the effectiveness of adaptation actions. This section of the toolbox lists **key indicators** relevant to climate risk and Nature-Based Solutions, and provides guidance on how to obtain or calculate them. It also explains how the toolbox links to external datasets through CKAN, enabling dynamic updates as new data becomes available.

**Risk and Vulnerability Indicators:** These measure aspects of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability:

* _Hazard Indicators:_ e.g. **Annual days of extreme rainfall** (for flood hazard), **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)** or reservoir levels (for drought), **Forest Fire Weather Index** (for wildfire danger), **Number of heatwave days** or **maximum summer temperature** (for heatwave intensity). Such metrics quantify the magnitude or frequency of climate hazards.
* _Exposure Indicators:_ e.g. **Population in high-risk zones** (number of people or % of population in floodplain or wildfire interface), **Value of assets exposed** (e.g. economic value of buildings in a flood zone), **Land area exposed**(hectares of agricultural land prone to drought or forest area prone to fires), or **Critical infrastructure density** in hazard areas (hospitals, power stations, etc.).
* _Vulnerability Indicators:_ e.g. **Social Vulnerability Index** combining factors like age, income, and health (higher for communities less able to cope); **Infrastructure resilience** (perhaps length of flood defenses, or % of homes with cooling systems for heat); **Ecosystem health** markers (forest cover integrity affecting wildfire vulnerability, soil moisture or groundwater levels affecting drought resilience).

These indicators help pinpoint why certain areas or groups are at risk. The toolbox can present an **Indicator Matrix**mapping each hazard to relevant indicators. For example, for _floods_ one might track “flood peak flow (m³/s)”, “people in 100-year flood zone”, and “% of area with natural floodplain vegetation” as a resilience indicator. It’s important to cite standards or references for these indicators where possible, or to align with existing frameworks (like the Sendai Framework’s indicators for disaster losses, or EU Adaptation Strategy monitoring indicators).

**NbS Performance Indicators:** In addition to risk indicators, the toolbox highlights metrics to monitor Nature-Based Solution implementation and effectiveness:

* **Implementation Metrics:** e.g. area of ecosystems restored (hectares of wetland or forest restored), number of green infrastructure projects completed, tree canopy cover in urban areas (%), length of rivers restored to natural course, volume of stormwater stored by new retention features.
*   **Outcome Metrics:** e.g. reduction in peak runoff or flood extent due to an NBS project (perhaps modeled), increase in groundwater recharge, reduction in ambient air temperature (°C) in areas with new urban greening, improvement in biodiversity or water quality indices. For instance, adding green roofs and parks might be linked to a measurable drop in urban temperatures during heatwaves or reduced runoff during heavy rain​

This section will guide users on linking indicators with data. Each indicator listed can have a short description, suggested data source (with a link if the dataset is on CKAN or elsewhere), and notes on calculation. For example: _“**Population in flood zone:** Data from regional census and flood hazard map (2020) – see CKAN dataset ‘Flood\_Zones\_EmiliaRomagna’ – can be combined to estimate this. Calculate by overlaying population grid with flood extent.”_ Wherever possible, provide direct links or references to where the user can find the data in the CKAN platform or other open data portals.

By compiling these indicators, cities can establish a **baseline** and later track progress. The toolbox might also suggest visualizations, such as dashboards or GIS map layers, to help communicate these indicators to decision-makers. It’s important that this indicator list is adaptable – users can add local indicators that matter (e.g. a cultural heritage risk indicator if that’s a priority for the region). The provided examples serve as a starting point and can be localized.
