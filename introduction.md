# Introduction



Climate change is intensifying natural hazards worldwide, posing heightened risks from floods, droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves. Regions and cities need practical tools to assess their vulnerabilities and plan adaptation measures. This **Climate Risk Assessment Toolbox** is a digital guide designed to help local governments integrate **Nature-Based Solutions (NbS)** into climate adaptation planning. It provides a template that can be adapted to any region – for example, the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, which has recently faced catastrophic flooding and extreme heat ​[ib-green.nweurope.eu](https://ib-green.nweurope.eu/blog/ib-green-news-26/focus-on-adaptation-70).&#x20;

The toolbox consolidates best practices, methodologies, and data resources in a structured format, suitable for deployment on platforms like GitHub Pages or GitBook for easy access and collaboration. It links to external data (to be hosted on a CKAN data portal) so that users can incorporate up-to-date climate information and indicators for their specific locale. The ultimate goal is to support evidence-based decision-making, helping communities become more resilient by leveraging the power of natural systems.
