## Introduction and Objectives of the Climate Risk Assessment

### Regional context.

The [Vollsmose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vollsmose) district,
located in the city of [Odense](https://english.odense.dk/) , Denmark,
is a dense urban neighbourhood currently undergoing a major renewal
programme. The area faces multiple water-related risks linked to
changing **rainfall patterns, shallow groundwater, and diffuse surface
pollution.**

High-intensity precipitation events frequently exceed the drainage
system’s capacity, leading to pluvial flooding. Elevated groundwater
levels reduce the effectiveness of sewers and increase flood
susceptibility. Untreated runoff entering local water bodies contributes
to water quality degradation, threatening aquatic habitats and urban
livability

The combination of urban densification, climate change, and existing
infrastructure limitations makes Vollsmose a priority site for **testing
integrated stormwater management approaches**. In this context,
Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) and Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) are
central to the urban renewal strategy, aiming to retain, store, and
treat stormwater locally, while also delivering co-benefits such as
biodiversity enhancement, reduced carbon footprint, and improved urban
quality of life.

### Scope of the tutorial

This tutorial describes a replicable Climate Risk Assessment (CRA)
**workflow for urban stormwater management** in the Vollsmose district.
The focus is on 2 of the 3 interrelated hazards present in the area:
**pluvial flooding and surface water quality degradation.**

The workflow combines high-resolution terrain and land-use datasets,
precipitation and hydrological records, and drainage network data with
modelling tools for runoff, drainage, and pollutant transport. It shows
how to evaluate the effectiveness of Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) and
Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) in retaining stormwater, reducing peak
discharges, and improving water quality.

The approach is designed for transferability: it integrates both open
European datasets (e.g. Copernicus) and local proprietary data (e.g.
sewer network, utility monitoring) to ensure that similar assessments
can be replicated in other urban contexts.

> This tutorial is intended as a general workflow example and does not
> replace software-specific documentation (e.g. GIS, hydrological, or
> urban drainage modelling tools user/technical manuals). Users should

### CRA objectives

The Vollsmose CRA aims to:

  - **Manage stormwater flooding** — Identify zones where high-intensity
    rainfall exceeds drainage capacity and assess retention needs.

  - **Improve water quality** — Quantify pollutant loads in stormwater
    and identify NbS that can retain and treat runoff before entering
    the wider system.

  - **Integrate NbS into planning** — Support the design of sustainable
    drainage infrastructure, including rainwater basins, swales, and
    permeable surfaces, aligned with the urban renewal process.

  - **Promote multiple co-benefits** — Link stormwater management to
    broader goals such as biodiversity support, low-carbon urban design,
    and improved urban livability.

  - **Enable scenario testing** — Provide a framework for comparing
    baseline and NbS-enhanced conditions under current and future
    climate scenarios.

### Intended Users

This Climate Risk Assessment is intended for **urban planners and water
managers** involved in the renewal of the Vollsmose district. It
supports the technical departments of Odense Municipality and the local
utility company VandCenter Syd in designing sustainable drainage
infrastructure under changing rainfall conditions.

The workflow also assists **environmental consultants and landscape
architects** in evaluating the performance of Nature-Based Solutions
(NbS) for stormwater retention and water quality improvement. Public
health authorities may use the outputs to identify areas where
stormwater pollution intersects with vulnerable communities.

In this context, the CRA results guide the planning and siting of
**stormwater storage basins and local retention/treatment systems**, as
well as the creation of **ecological corridors and water-linked
habitats**. These NbS reduce peak flows, improve water quality, and
generate co-benefits for biodiversity and urban livability.

## Flood Hazard – Pluvial stormwater mapping 

### Description and context

The first stage of the pluvial flooding assessment focuses on **mapping
surface runoff and identifying critical accumulation areas under intense
rainfall events.** High-resolution topographic data are combined with
rainfall statistics to simulate overland flow pathways, depressions, and
temporary storage zones.

Tools such as @@@ process LiDAR-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEM)
to delineate flow paths, ponding areas, and stormwater storage
potential. These outputs **highlight where rainfall volumes concentrate
during extreme events**, providing a first screening of **flood-prone
zones** within the urban fabric.

This mapping step does not simulate the hydraulic performance of the
sewer network, but it delivers decision-ready layers for urban planners.
The results support the siting and preliminary sizing of Nature-Based
Solutions (NbS), such as stormwater retention basins or open drainage
features, and establish the baseline conditions for more detailed
drainage modelling.

### Data sources and tools

The runoff mapping workflow in Vollsmose relies on a combination of
topographic, hydrological, and land-use datasets. High-resolution
elevation models form the basis for identifying depressions, flow paths,
and potential storage zones across the urban landscape. Rainfall
observations provide the forcing conditions to simulate surface
accumulation during intense events. Land cover and soil information are
used to distinguish impermeable from permeable areas, while building
footprints refine the representation of urban morphology and its
influence on water routing.

For replication outside Denmark, open European datasets such as
Copernicus DEM, CORINE Land Cover, and ERA5 precipitation data offer
alternative inputs, albeit at coarser resolution. These allow the
workflow to be applied beyond the local context, ensuring comparability
and transferability across regions.

Surface runoff mapping in Vollsmose combines proprietary platforms and
open-source GIS environments. Terrain-based **tools** process
high-resolution LiDAR elevation data to identify runoff pathways,
ponding areas, and potential stormwater storage volumes. These results
provide rapid, visual outputs that help planners screen flood-prone
areas and evaluate the effectiveness of preliminary Nature-Based
Solutions (NbS).

Cloud-based services, frequently offered as proprietary solutions, allow
quick interactive scenario testing under different rainfall events,
while open-source GIS software coupled with desktop-based alternatives
may supports integration of hazard layers with land use and exposure
datasets using open resources.

The combination ensures that outputs can be both locally precise and
transferable to other contexts using alternative datasets and open
tools:

### Methodology

#### Step 1 - Data acquisition and preparation

##### The first step in the runoff mapping workflow is to collect and prepare the spatial and hydrological datasets. A high-resolution Digital Terrain Model (DTM), typically derived from LiDAR surveys, is required to represent depressions, flow paths, and storage zones across the urban landscape.

  - ##### Note on DEM resolution.

> When using very high-resolution LiDAR DEMs (e.g. 0.4 m), the data can
> become too heavy for hydraulic modelling. A practical solution is to
> down sample to 1–2 m resolution, which is still reasonable for flood
> modelling. This can be done through mosaicking and resampling in GIS
> software (e.g. QGIS) or by using command-line tools such as GDAL. For
> example:
> 
> gdalwarp --config GDAL\_NUM\_THREADS ALL\_CPUS -r bilinear -tr 1,2 1,2
> -t\_srs EPSG:25832 -co COMPRESS=LZW -co BIGTIFF=YES -co PREDICTOR=2
> c:/folder1/\*.tif c:/folder1/mosaic.tif
> 
> For further reference, see the GDAL [*gdalwarp
> documentation*](https://gdal.org/en/stable/programs/gdalwarp.html).

Building footprints could be overlaid on the terrain to include such
obstacles, remove artificial depressions generated by LiDAR filtering
algorithms and improve the accuracy of flow routing.

Rainfall time series are used to define design storm events for the
mapping simulations. These can be derived from national meteorological
services (e.g. DMI) or from European datasets (e.g. ERA5-Land) when
local data are not available. Land use and land cover data are
harmonized to distinguish impervious from pervious areas, supporting
runoff estimates and NbS siting.

All datasets are then converted into GIS-compatible formats and
spatially aligned. Terrain and land cover layers are prepared for input
into flood mapping tools.

platform).

#### Step 2 – Model setup and run.

In the surface runoff workflow, the pre-processed terrain and rainfall
datasets are imported into dedicated mapping platforms to simulate how
stormwater accumulates and spreads across the urban area during intense
precipitation events. The core representation is based on the
LiDAR-derived terrain, which defines depressions and flow paths, while
design storms provide the forcing input. The model produces estimates of
ponding areas, water depths, and storage zones, plus preferential flow
direction downstream, offering an initial picture of pluvial flood
exposure.

](content/drive/MyDrive/GECO_RESEARCH/17_R&D_ARCADIA_HORIZ_GIS_10112023_S/WP8/Tutorials/gitbook_repo/_tmp_assets/DEN-Lab1_Vollsmose_draft2_media/media/image4.png)](content/drive/MyDrive/GECO_RESEARCH/17_R&D_ARCADIA_HORIZ_GIS_10112023_S/WP8/Tutorials/gitbook_repo/_tmp_assets/DEN-Lab1_Vollsmose_draft2_media/media/image5.png)Different
levels of complexity can be applied depending on the platform. Some
systems rely on simplified, zero-dimensional approaches where rainfall
is converted into accumulated volumes within depressions without
representing the dynamic propagation of flow. These methods are
efficient for screening and for highlighting potential hot spots of
flooding at the end of an event. More sophisticated approaches allow
advanced dynamic modelling, where rainfall is applied continuously over
the domain and surface routing is represented in time and space,
capturing the dynamics of the rainfall flood event. This provides a more
realistic simulation of flood wave propagation, flow velocities, and
temporary storage, but requires greater computational effort and more
detailed parameterisation. *In the following figures, we illustrate this
difference for a small test area: the left image shows results from a
static zero-dimensional model simulating a 100 mm rainfall event lasting
two hours, while the right image shows the envelope of maximum water
depth over six hours produced by a two-dimensional dynamic model.*

watersheds and downstream linkages among them (courtesy of
[SaferPlaces](https://saferplaces.co/rimini-and-climate-change-the-added-value-of-the-sea-park-parco-del-mare/)
platform).

The choice between static and dynamic approaches depends on the
objectives of the analysis and the capacities of the modelling tool.

Both provide useful decision-ready layers for planning, ranging from
rapid screening of vulnerable zones to detailed assessment of runoff
dynamics under different rainfall scenarios.

  - ##### Note: role of land use/cover and soil properties

> sealed surfaces and lower values for permeable areas). This
> conservative assumption reflects the rapid saturation of soils and the
> limited capacity of urban drainage systems, providing a safety margin
> while remaining reasonably realistic.*

#### Step 3 – Analysis and interpretation

The outputs of the surface runoff simulations consist of water depth and
flood extent maps that highlight low-lying areas and critical
accumulation zones (Figure 2.). These layers are best interpreted in a
GIS environment, where they can be overlaid with exposure datasets such
as land cover, buildings, or redevelopment areas. This integration makes
it possible to identify priority sites for stormwater retention and to
evaluate the contribution of NbS to flood mitigation.

In the example below, a flood depth map has been combined with a land
cover layer. By applying simple zonal statistics, two key indicators can
be derived: the fraction of each land use polygon affected by
inundation, and the stormwater volume stored within each polygon. Such
indicators provide direct evidence for ranking areas according to their
vulnerability, and they support the siting of mitigation measures. This
type of analysis aligns with the objectives of Lab1, where stormwater
management and NbS integration are central to the Vollsmose renewal
strategy.

](content/drive/MyDrive/GECO_RESEARCH/17_R&D_ARCADIA_HORIZ_GIS_10112023_S/WP8/Tutorials/gitbook_repo/_tmp_assets/DEN-Lab1_Vollsmose_draft2_media/media/image7.png)

Figure 3 – Figure X – Example of GIS overlay analysis combining flood
water depth maps with land cover polygons. Zonal statistics allow the
calculation of key indicators such as the fraction of each land use unit
affected by inundation and the corresponding stormwater volume stored.
These outputs support the ranking of vulnerable areas and the siting of
Nature-Based Solutions in the Vollsmose district.

In addition to basic overlays with land cover, more advanced analyses
can be performed depending on the capabilities of the platform or the
availability of additional toolboxes. For example, flood depth layers
can be intersected with building footprint data and linked to water
depth–damage curves (\[1\]). These curves are typically site-specific
and differentiated by asset type (e.g. residential, commercial,
industrial), providing an approximate estimation of potential economic
losses.

While simplified, this approach illustrates how hazard maps can be
translated into impact assessments, offering a proxy for the value of
exposed assets and supporting the prioritization of protection and
mitigation measures within the renewal project (Figure 4

](content/drive/MyDrive/GECO_RESEARCH/17_R&D_ARCADIA_HORIZ_GIS_10112023_S/WP8/Tutorials/gitbook_repo/_tmp_assets/DEN-Lab1_Vollsmose_draft2_media/media/image8.png)

Figure 4 - Example of impact assessment using flood depth maps combined
with building footprints and depth–damage curves (lower right). This
overlay provides a proxy estimate of potential losses for different
asset categories (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial), supporting
the prioritization of mitigation measures, (courtesy of
[SaferPlaces](https://saferplaces.co/rimini-and-climate-change-the-added-value-of-the-sea-park-parco-del-mare/)
platform).

#### Step 4 – Testing of measures.

In the surface‐runoff workflow, NbS options are tested by modifying the
topographic or parametric representation of the urban surface and
repeating the same design storms used for the baseline. In this Lab the
focus is on **stormwater storage basins** and **local surface retention
features** that delay and hold runoff before it reaches the wider
system; habitat and corridor elements can be represented insofar as they
act as open surface waterways guiding flow along preferred paths. This
stage remains surface-based: sewer hydraulics and pollutant processes
are addressed in the separate drainage and water-quality workflow.

Practically, interventions are emulated **by editing the analysis
terrain and related layers:** inserting depressions to represent new
storage basins; adding break lines or shallow channels to steer overland
flow and connect storage cells; and, where supported, adjusting surface
roughness or simple infiltration parameters to reflect retention
performance. Each scenario is run under the same rainfall events as the
baseline to foster comparison with/wo Nbs deployment.

**Outputs are interpreted with the same GIS procedures** used for the
baseline: water-depth and accumulation maps are overlaid with planning
layers to quantify changes in flooded extent, shifts in flow paths, and
increases in temporary storage. Simple indicators—such as reduction in
inundated area within redevelopment polygons and additional stormwater
volume held in proposed basins—provide decision-ready evidence for
siting and preliminary sizing of NbS within the Vollsmose renewal
strategy.

## Flood Hazard – Urban drainage and water quality modelling 

### Description and context

The second part of the workflow focuses on **stormwater management
through the simulation of the urban drainage system.** While surface
runoff mapping provides a first screening of accumulation zones based on
topography, this step examines how rainfall is conveyed and stored
within the sewer network and associated detention structures.

In Vollsmose, stormwater handling is a major concern for the renewal
project. More frequent and **intense rainfall events increase the load
on the drainage system,** while high groundwater levels reduce its
effectiveness and contribute to local flooding. In parallel, **untreated
surface runoff often reaches receiving waters**, carrying **nutrients
and sediments that degrade water quality.** For this reason, retention
and treatment of stormwater are central objectives alongside improved
drainage capacity.

**Urban drainage and water quality models** provide a way to represent
these processes explicitly. They describe the hydraulic behaviour of
sewer pipes, basins, and outlets, simulate where surcharge or flooding
may occur under extreme events, and estimate pollutant transport within
the system. By assigning typical pollutant concentrations to inflows
(e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, suspended solids), it becomes possible to
test how **NbS and alternative management options affect both hydraulic
performance and water quality before discharge.**

This modelling **complements surface-based analyses (**Flood Hazard –
Pluvial stormwater mapping **)** by showing how the drainage network
functions under stress, and how interventions such as additional storage
or treatment can reduce flood risk and improve water quality. It
therefore provides further evidence base needed to integrate NbS into
the Vollsmose renewal strategy.

Table 1 - key indicators tracked- Pluvial stormwater mapping

### Data sources and tools

Drainage and water quality modelling requires, in addition to terrain
and rainfall data already used for runoff mapping, a s**et of
operational and utility datasets that describe the structure and
functioning of the sewer system**. These include pipe layouts, detention
basins, outlet structures, and flow monitoring where available. Such
information allows the construction of schematic hydraulic models that
simulate surcharge, storage, and pollutant transport under heavy
rainfall events.

To address the **water quality dimension, typical inflow concentrations
of pollutants** such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended solids are
required. These values may be obtained from local monitoring programs,
utility databases, or national environmental data portals. Where direct
measurements are not available, literature-based default values are
often used as proxies for urban stormwater

In addition to basic data listed in the previous workflow (Table 3)
further specific data are needed to perform such kind of assessment,
Because of the highly site-specific nature of urban drainage and water
quality modelling, **the datasets required do not have generic European
counterparts**. This workflow can therefore only be implemented where
detailed local utility and monitoring data are available.

For the simulation of sewer hydraulics and stormwater quality,
d**edicated urban drainage modelling platforms are required.** Unlike
surface runoff mapping, these tools represent explicitly the hydraulic
behaviour of the sewer network, including pipe surcharge, storage in
detention basins, and pollutant routing.

In this workflow, we mention some reference models which allows the
schematic representation of catchments, nodes, conduits, and outlets,
together with the assignment of inflow hydrographs and pollutant
concentrations. They support both hydraulic calculations (e.g. flow,
surcharge, water levels) and water quality simulation (e.g. nitrogen,
phosphorus, suspended solids) under rainfall forcing.

These tools rely on (usually) georeferenced base data and standard GIS
tools already introduced in the runoff mapping workflow for catchment
delineation and spatial integration with other thematic layers. Their
added value is in the dynamic simulation of hydraulic and quality
processes within the sewer network, providing evidence to assess
vulnerabilities and test NbS interventions in the Vollsmose renewal
project.

### Methodology

#### Step 1 - Data acquisition and preparation

The first step in network-based stormwater modelling is to assemble the
datasets that describe both the physical infrastructure and the boundary
conditions driving its operation. Sewer system geometry is required to
define the hydraulic layout: pipes, nodes, manholes, detention basins,
and outlets form the skeleton of the model. These elements are
complemented by attributes such as pipe diameters, slopes, invert
levels, and basin storage capacities, typically obtained from utility
records or municipal databases (Figure 5).

Inflow allocation is derived from delineating sub catchments and
connecting them to specific nodes of the network. This step ensures
consistency with the runoff mapping performed earlier: surface runoff
volumes generated on terrain and land cover maps are routed to the
correct entry points of the drainage system.

Rainfall time series represent the main forcing for the hydraulic
simulations. For design events, synthetic storms of predefined duration
and depth can be applied to test network response under critical
conditions. For long-term analyses, however, continuous time series over
several months can be used to capture the cumulative effects of repeated
storm events, seasonal variability, and groundwater interactions.

Given the relatively small scale of most urban drainage studies (single
neighbourhoods or sub-catchments), it is generally sufficient to rely on
one or a few nearby meteorological stations. For example In Denmark, the
Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) provides access to
[**Meteorological Observation
Data**](https://opendatadocs.dmi.govcloud.dk/en/Data/Meteorological_Observation_Data)
and **Climate Data** that have undergone quality control.

Figure 6 - Image of synop station from DMI Meteorological Observation
Data system, source DMI Open Data.

Data may be downloaded and prepared as time series (typical standard
format like .csv) of hourly/sub hourly time steps depending on station
data recording capabilities.

For water quality assessment, pollutant input parameters shall be
prepared. These include typical concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus,
and suspended solids in stormwater inflows. When local monitoring data
are missing, literature-based default values or regulatory guidelines
may serve as proxies ( see Note) In either case, pollutant inflows are
assigned to sub catchments or specific nodes, depending on model
requirements , enabling the model to simulate pollutant routing and
treatment performance under heavy rainfall scenarios.

As a reference, Denmark provides open access to environmental monitoring
data through the [**Kemidata
portal**](https://kemidata.miljoeportal.dk/), which compiles information
on chemical and ecological status of surface waters. Such datasets can
serve as benchmarks for calibrating or validating simulated pollutant
concentrations and for assessing whether stormwater treatment measures
help meet water quality objectives. The following figure illustrates an
example of surface water monitoring data available from Kemidata, which
can be integrated into the analysis as an external point of comparison.

Danish Kemidata portal

This structured preparation allows the transition from a purely
terrain-based representation of stormwater to a full network model,
where hydraulic loads, surcharge risks, and pollutant transport can be
quantified in detail.

#### Step 2 – Model setup and run.

In the drainage and water quality workflow, the **schematic
representation of the sewer system** is built from local utility
datasets. Pipes, manholes, detention basins, and outlets are represented
as nodes and links, while sub catchments are connected to the network
through inflow locations. Rainfall time series, either design storms or
continuous observations, are then assigned to each sub catchment to
generate inflows.

**Hydraulic routing** is usually performed by solving the Saint-Venant
equations or simplified kinematic/dynamic wave formulations, depending
on the modelling tool. This allows the simulation of surcharge,
pressurised flow, and storage in detention basins.

At the same time, **pollutant loads** (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus,
suspended solids) are assigned to inflows through build-up and washoff
functions or typical event mean concentrations. These pollutants are
then routed with the water flow, enabling an evaluation of how volumes
and concentrations evolve across the network and at the outlets (Figure
7).

The model setup requires careful parameterization of catchment
properties, conveyance elements, and boundary conditions. Calibration
against observed flow or level data, where available, is strongly
recommended to ensure reliability. Once established, the model can be
run under multiple rainfall scenarios to test both hydraulic performance
and water quality outcomes of the network.

The following figures illustrate the conceptual modelling of an urban
drainage network, including sub catchments, hydraulic conduits (pipes),
and key junctions. For selected nodes or links, both hydraulic inflows
and water quality parameters (e.g. Total Suspended Solids – TSS) can be
simulated under different design or land-use scenarios. These
visualisations, adapted from the SWMM manual, show how network models
can assess stormwater volumes and pollutant loads, supporting the
comparison between conventional infrastructure and Nature-based
Solutions (NbS) in reducing peak flows and improving water quality.

from **[SWMM 5.2 User
Manual](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-04/swmm-users-manual-version-5.2.pdf))**

#### Step 3 – Analysis and interpretation

The results of the drainage and water quality simulations provide
**quantitative information on how the system responds to rainfall
events.** Hydraulic outputs such as flow rates, water levels, and
surcharge frequencies at critical nodes indicate where the sewer system
is most vulnerable to overload. These metrics can be used to identify
bottlenecks in the network and to prioritise locations were additional
storage, increased pipe capacity, or NbS interventions may be most
effective.

On the water quality side, pollutant concentrations and loads (e.g.
nitrogen, phosphorus, suspended solids) at outlets or detention basins
highlight the potential impact on receiving waters. **By comparing
results under different rainfall scenarios or land-use conditions,** the
model can show both the magnitude and timing of pollutant discharges,
supporting the design of measures for stormwater treatment.

Interpretation should therefore focus on linking hydraulic stress points
and pollutant loads to planning and management decisions. **This may
involve ranking vulnerable nodes, estimating exceedance probabilities,
or assessing the reduction of pollutant export achieved by NbS.** When
combined with GIS-based overlays of land use or sensitive receptors, the
results provide an integrated basis for decision-making on flood
mitigation and water quality improvement in urban environments.

*For example, results may show that a critical junction in the sewer
system experiences surcharging once every two years under a 20-year
return period storm, or that installing a detention basin reduces peak
flow at node X by 25%. Similarly, simulations may indicate that average
TSS concentrations at the outlet decrease from 90 mg/L to 60 mg/L when
green infrastructure is introduced in upstream sub catchments. Such
indicators make it possible to quantify both hydraulic and ecological
benefits of proposed interventions, supporting their prioritisation in
the planning process.*

Figure 9 – example of m maximum overflow volumes \[m3\] per sewer node
under a design storm scenario, visualised as point features in a GIS
environment. Node size and colour scale reflect the simulated overflow
volume (m³), highlighting critical areas of surcharge that may guide the
prioritisation of NbS interventions and network upgrades.

#### Step 4 – Testing of measures.

In this final step, the drainage and water quality model are used to
evaluate the **performance of Nature-Based Solutions (NbS)** that have
been identified for the Vollsmose renewal project. The focus is on
solutions that both mitigate flooding and improve water quality, while
also contributing to ecological and urban liveability goals.

**Stormwater retention and storage structures,** such as **detention
basins or green areas**, can be introduced into the network schematics
to absorb peak inflows and delay discharges. By rerunning the hydraulic
simulations with these features activated, differences in surcharge
volumes at critical nodes and reductions in peak flow rates can be
quantified.

In parallel, **treatment-oriented NbS, such as vegetated retention areas
or biofiltration units,** can be represented as additional storage nodes
with pollutant removal functions. This allows the model to simulate
reductions in nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended solids at the outlets,
providing insight into the contribution of NbS to water quality
improvements.

Where shallow groundwater is a concern, measures that enhance
infiltration or relieve pressure on the drainage system can also be
tested, though their representation depends on available data and tool
capabilities.

The effectiveness of these measures can be assessed by comparing key
indicators from baseline and intervention scenarios, including:

  - peak discharge flow rate at critical nodes,

  - pollutant concentrations (N, P, TSS) at selected outlets,

  - and overall stormwater retention volumes.

By systematically applying Steps 2 and 3 to both baseline and
NbS-enhanced scenarios, the workflow provides evidence of how NbS can
reduce flood risk, lower pollutant loads, and generate co-benefits for
habitat creation and urban resilience.
