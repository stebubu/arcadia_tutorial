# Nature-Based Solutions Library

Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) protect, restore, or mimic natural processes to address climate risks. This library contains entries for:

* **Green Roofs & Urban Greening:** Mitigating urban heat and managing stormwater.
* **Wetland and Floodplain Restoration:** Enhancing natural water retention.
* **Coastal & Riverine Restoration:** Improving natural buffers.
* **Urban Tree Canopy Expansion:** Reducing heat islands and improving air quality.



At the heart of the toolbox is a library of **Nature-Based Solutions** – a menu of strategies that leverage natural processes to reduce climate risks while providing co-benefits. According to the UNEA definition, NbS are _“actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or modified ecosystems, which address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits.”_&#x200B;

[naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org](https://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/news/united-nations-environment-assembly-nature-based-solutions-definition)In this section, users will find an overview of major NbS categories relevant to the identified climate risks, with guidance on when and how to implement them. The library can be organized by ecosystem or by the type of risk they address. For clarity, the toolbox may use sub-pages or sub-sections for each NbS category:

*   **Wetland and Floodplain Restoration:** Reconnecting rivers to their floodplains, restoring wetlands, and conserving natural retention areas. These measures increase water storage capacity, slow down runoff, and can significantly reduce flood peaks downstream​

    [deltares.nl](https://www.deltares.nl/en/news/rapid-design-of-nature-based-solutions-with-new-tool)​[deltares.nl](https://www.deltares.nl/en/news/rapid-design-of-nature-based-solutions-with-new-tool). _Use case:_ Emilia-Romagna’s Po River basin could benefit from reconnecting former wetlands to absorb floodwaters. Co-benefits include water purification, habitat for wildlife, and drought mitigation (as wetlands release water in dry periods).
*   **Urban Green Infrastructure:** Enhancing green spaces and permeable surfaces in cities – green roofs, rain gardens, bioswales, urban forests, and parks. These measures tackle urban flooding by improving infiltration and drainage, and combat heatwaves by providing shade and evapotranspiration cooling. _Example:_ Installing green roofs can reduce stormwater runoff and lower city temperatures; the European Environment Agency notes green roofs as a key urban adaptation to prevent flooding and save energy​

    [eea.europa.eu](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-impacts-risks-and-adaptation). Co-benefits include improved air quality and recreational spaces for residents.
* **Reforestation and Afforestation:** Planting trees or allowing natural regeneration in strategic locations (e.g. upstream watersheds, hillsides, burned areas). Forests reduce runoff, stabilize soil (preventing landslides, which often accompany floods), and can dampen wildfire spread by creating moister, shaded environments (though species selection and management is crucial to avoid excess fuel load). Reforestation in water catchments helps maintain streamflow in drought conditions and enhances carbon sequestration.
* **Agroforestry and Sustainable Agriculture:** Integrating trees or restoring soils in agricultural lands to increase resilience to droughts and heat. Measures include shelterbelts to reduce heat stress on crops, improving soil organic matter to retain moisture, and restoring riparian buffers to reduce flood damage. These practices help secure food production under climate stress and sequester carbon, while also reducing erosion and runoff.
* **Coastal Nature-Based Solutions:** _(If applicable to the region)_ Restoration of dunes, mangroves, salt marshes, or other coastal ecosystems to buffer against storm surges and sea-level rise. Even for an inland region, this can be relevant if there are river deltas or coastal zones (Emilia-Romagna has an Adriatic coastline). Natural coastal features attenuate waves and provide habitat, offering protection that grows over time as ecosystems mature, unlike static concrete seawalls.
* **Other Ecosystem-based Adaptations:** This can include a variety of measures like **river restoration** (removing obsolete dams, improving flow for floods and droughts), **peatland restoration** (to retain water and carbon), **grassland conservation** (for wildfire management and grazing drought resilience), and **blue-green infrastructure networks** that connect various green spaces for cumulative benefits.

&#x20;_Restoring natural wetlands and streams is a powerful NbS for flood and drought management. By allowing floodplains to retain water (as shown above), peak flows are reduced and groundwater is recharged, mitigating flood damages and providing water reserves for dry periods. Such approaches in rural areas of Emilia-Romagna could help buffer extreme rainfall events while enhancing biodiversity._

For each NbS type, the toolbox provides:

* **Description:** How the solution works and its relevance to certain climate risks.
* **Benefits:** Both the primary risk reduction benefit and co-benefits (e.g. wetlands reduce floods and also support biodiversity; urban trees reduce heat and also improve air quality).
* **Suitable Context:** Where this solution is most applicable (urban vs rural, specific ecosystem or land use conditions, social acceptability, etc.).
* **Implementation Considerations:** Practical tips or requirements – e.g. need for community involvement, maintenance needs, possible trade-offs (like land use changes).
*   **Examples or Case Studies:** Brief examples of the NbS in action. This could reference external case studies (with links) or a local example. _For instance:_ _“The city of Modena is exploring increased green spaces and water features in an industrial district to combat heat stress​_

    [_ib-green.nweurope.eu_](https://ib-green.nweurope.eu/blog/ib-green-news-26/focus-on-adaptation-70)_. Suggested measures include planting shade trees, creating water reservoirs for irrigation, and replacing pavement with permeable surfaces to manage rainwater.”_ In the toolbox, we can link to any detailed case study in the Case Studies section or external sites for further reading.
* **External Resources:** Links to guidelines, design manuals, or tools specific to that solution (for example, a link to a wetland restoration guide or an urban green infrastructure toolkit).

This library serves as a **reference for planners** to match identified risks with possible NbS interventions. It encourages a multi-pronged approach – often a combination of solutions (green corridors, parks, wetlands, etc.) is needed to address the spectrum of risks. The content stresses that NbS should be chosen to fit local conditions and can complement engineered measures. Users are reminded to consider **hybrid solutions** (e.g. a levee set-back combined with restored riparian vegetation) for maximum efficacy. By using this library, adaptation planners can compile a portfolio of potential measures to evaluate for their climate action plans.
