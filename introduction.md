# Introduction

Climate change is intensifying natural hazards worldwide, posing heightened risks from floods, droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves. Regions and cities need practical tools to assess their vulnerabilities and plan adaptation measures.&#x20;

This **Climate Risk Assessment Toolbox** is a digital guide designed to help local governments integrate **Nature-Based Solutions (NbS)**  and **Blue-Green Infrastructures** **(BGI)** into climate adaptation planning.

&#x20;The **CRA\_toolbox** is developed in response to the identified needs and climate challenges from the Innovation Labs of the ARCADIA project. Its primary aim is to equip the Labs across the region with comprehensive guidelines, methodologies, data, and tutorials. This resource is critical in aiding the assessment of adaptation and mitigation benefits offered by various **Nature-Based Solutions (NbS)** and **Blue-Green Infrastructures (BGI)**. By facilitating access to structured information, the CRA\_toolbox supports stakeholders in making informed decisions that bolster the resilience of their respective regions. More information on these Innovation Labs can be found on the [ARCADIA project website](https://www.arcadia-adaptation.eu/index.php/the-project/co-innovation-labs/).

The toolbox consolidates best practices, methodologies, and data resources in a structured format, suitable for deployment on platforms like GitHub Pages or GitBook for easy access and collaboration. It links to external data (to be hosted on a CKAN data portal) so that users can incorporate up-to-date climate information and indicators for their specific locale. The ultimate goal is to support evidence-based decision-making, helping communities become more resilient by leveraging the power of natural systems.
