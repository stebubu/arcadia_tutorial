# Emilia-Romagna (Italy) Case Study

**Context:**\
Emilia-Romagna is a region in northern Italy known for its diverse landscapes, including urban centers and agricultural zones. The region is exposed to multiple climate risks, such as floods and heatwaves.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Flooding:** Flood hazard maps indicate high risk along river systems.
* **Heatwaves:** Urban centers face increased temperatures and heat stress.

**Solutions Implemented:**

* _River Restoration:_ Reconnecting floodplains and enhancing natural buffers.
* _Urban Greening:_ Tree planting, green roofs, and the creation of parks.

**Outcomes & Lessons:**\
Early projects have improved resilience, reduced flood peaks, and lowered urban temperatures. Continuous monitoring and community involvement are crucial for long-term success.\

To illustrate how the toolbox can be applied and localized, this section provides a hypothetical (but data-informed) **use case for Emilia-Romagna, Italy**. It walks through each part of the toolbox with region-specific details, demonstrating to users how they might do the same for their region. Emilia-Romagna is an ideal example as it experiences a mix of climate risks: catastrophic floods in its plains and rivers, summer droughts affecting agriculture, increasing wildfire risk in the Apennine foothills, and intense heatwaves in its cities.

**Region Profile:** Emilia-Romagna is introduced with a brief profile – geography, climate, key economic sectors, and known vulnerabilities. For instance: a large portion of the region is the Po River plain (flood-prone), it has a coastline on the Adriatic (exposed to coastal flooding), intensive agriculture (sensitive to drought), and several midsize cities including Bologna and Modena (exposed to heatwaves). Recent events like the 2023 floods and heatwaves are noted to underline urgency​

**Risk Assessment Summary:** Using the methodology, the case study identifies priority risks:

* _Flooding:_ High risk along the Po and its tributaries; exposure includes thousands of homes and farmland. Data from flood hazard maps (e.g. those published by the Po River Authority, presumably on CKAN) show extensive 100-year flood zones. Vulnerability is heightened by land subsidence in some coastal areas and aging levees.
* _Drought:_ High risk in summer for agriculture and water supply. Indicators like rainfall trends and reservoir levels indicate a drying trend. Exposure: agriculture in the region (especially in southern plains) and the water demands of cities. Vulnerability: intense water use (irrigation-dependent crops) and ecosystems like the Po delta wetlands that are sensitive to salinization during drought.
* _Wildfire:_ Moderate but growing risk in the Apennine hills, particularly in summers after dry winters. Exposure: forested and rural communities in the hills. The region’s forests are not adapted to frequent fire, making them vulnerable during extreme conditions.
*   _Heatwave:_ Severe risk in urban centers. Indicators show a rising number of tropical nights (hot nights) in cities like Bologna. Exposure: \~4 million residents region-wide, especially urban dwellers. Vulnerability: many elderly residents, and city neighborhoods with limited green space (like parts of Modena’s industrial area​

Present this summary perhaps in a table format in the toolbox for clarity, linking each risk to data sources. E.g., “Flood risk – Data from ISPRA flood maps (CKAN link); population exposed \~100,000; expected annual damage €X million.”

**Selected NbS Options:** Based on these risks, the case study outlines a portfolio of Nature-Based Solutions for Emilia-Romagna:

* For floods: _Restore floodplains along the Secchia and Reno rivers_, creating retention basins and wetlands upstream of towns. Also, _urban riverfront parks_ in cities like Bologna to act as flood water sinks. These align with measures in the NbS library (wetland restoration, urban green).
* For droughts: _Agroforestry initiatives_, like planting tree rows among crops in the Parma and Modena provinces to reduce evaporation and provide shade. _Wetland conservation_ in the Po Delta to maintain a buffer against drought and saltwater intrusion.
* For wildfires: _Forest management and reforestation_ with resilient species in the Apennines, creating fuel breaks that double as grazing lands or recreational parks (a green firebreak approach).
* For heatwaves: _Urban greening programs_, e.g. a “Green Bologna” plan to increase tree cover by X% and add green roofs on public buildings. _Blue infrastructure_ like fountains or ponds in city parks to provide cooling through evaporation.

The case study explains how these were chosen. It mentions using a multi-criteria workshop with stakeholders from regional government, municipalities, agriculture, etc., to rank options. It notes that NbS were favored due to their multi-benefit nature – e.g. floodplain restoration also improves biodiversity and water quality, which garnered support from environmental groups, while urban greening has health and aesthetic benefits valued by citizens.

**Implementation Plan Snapshot:** For Emilia-Romagna, outline a hypothetical implementation roadmap:

*   Years 1-2: Detailed studies and pilot projects (e.g. pilot floodplain restoration on a smaller tributary, pilot urban greening in Modena’s industrial district as referenced by IB-Green​

    [ib-green.nweurope.eu](https://ib-green.nweurope.eu/blog/ib-green-news-26/focus-on-adaptation-70)).
* Years 3-5: Scale up successful pilots, integrate actions into regional planning documents, secure funding (perhaps citing that the region could use EU Adaptation funds or national recovery funds).
* Ongoing: Establish a monitoring system – e.g. universities in Bologna could help track climate indicators and NbS performance (a collaboration opportunity).

**Outcomes and Lessons:** Conclude the case with expected outcomes: reduced flood peaks, more reliable water supply, cooler urban centers by mid-century, etc., along with co-benefits like recreation, improved air quality, habitat creation. Also, candidly note lessons or remaining challenges – maybe the need for cross-border cooperation on the Po River, or the importance of continuous community engagement, etc.

By walking through Emilia-Romagna, the toolbox gives users a concrete example of how to apply the template. It demonstrates how to plug in local data and context at each step – substituting their own region’s specifics while following the same general approach. Users from another region can take this example and mirror the process: fill in their hazard data, pick relevant NbS from the library, use the decision tools to prioritize, and plan implementation. The case study thus serves both as an illustration and a validation of the toolbox approach.
